This project is to facilitate people with online booking of marriage halls. The project is divided into two side Admin side (where hall owner can do Sign Up, Sign In, handle Inventory, handle booking request, handle sales). Customer Side (View hall, Search hall, Booking Request, Select Package) Second deliverable is all about the use-case modeling and software design. In the previous deliverable, analysis of the system is completed. So, I understand the current situation of the problem domain. Now I am ready to strive for a solution for the problem domain by using object-oriented approach.
